# Horama Port Scanner
Horama is a lightweight Python-based tool designed to detect open ports on a network device. It efficiently scans a specified range of ports (1 to 65 535) to identify which are open. As a prototype, it is a work-in-progress but provides a simple solution for basic port scanning tasks.
